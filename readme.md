Lets do a simple blog with django.

Initialize the project.

`django-admin startproject blog_example`


We'll assume this blog is part of a bigger website, so we'll try to contain all our files in a single place.

We'll create a django application to keep it separated from the rest, and to be easy to add to any other website.

`python manage.py startapp blog`
